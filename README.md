# Rune Factory 5 Faster Crafting and Upgrading
 A BepInEx mod for Rune Factory 5 that add shortcut key for upgrade and crafting items.

## Installation
- Install this [RF5Fix mod](https://github.com/Lyall/RF5Fix) (BepInEx included there).
- Put this mod dll to `BepInEx\plugins`.

## What this mod do
- Pressing `[Camp Menu]` (default Keyboard = Tab, DS4 = Start) will make you pressing ok button instantly.
- After upgrading item, it will try to move back the cursor (hand) back to item slot for the last item used.

## Known issues
Non-Fatal:
- `[Error  :FasterCrafting] Failed to find success Component!` always thrown when you open upgrade/craft menu, caused by some UI is not created yet.

## What to do next (for myself)
- Make craft and upgrade skip all the animation and little cutscene.
